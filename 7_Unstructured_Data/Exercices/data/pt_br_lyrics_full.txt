Thrash!
Mosh!
I met a bird that came from hell
He is little green, he is very well
He likes to play, he likes the milk
He likes to fight, he likes to kill
I met a bird that came from hell
He is little green, he is very well
He cannot fly and he is revolt
He don't like me and then he told
What?
Lôro
Lôro quer biscoito!
Lôro
Lôro quer biscoito!
Quer biscoito!
Evil Papagali, he wants to kill
He ordered me to puta que pariu
Evil Papagali, he is animal
He's got the power of heavy metal
He's got the power of the furation
You feel the pain, it's the bication
He's master of hell, and we're Massacration
He wants to speak to all the nation
Listen!
